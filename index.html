											<h2>Concept</h2>
										</header>
										<p class="content">Sometimes the term "chatbot" is used to refer to virtual voice assistants generally or specifically accessed by online chat. In some cases, online chat programs are only for entertainment purposes. With the development of artificial intelligence technology, people are no longer satisfied that some virtual voice assistants have only fun use instead of other practical uses.</p>

										<p class="content">My project is aiming to develop a new virtual voice assistant system focusing on the function of companionship. As it can be customized to meet different users, this system can be used in different areas of day-to-day life such as a digital butler, personal healthcare management, and even a digital friend or companion. When it is functioning its voice recognition system, it not only responds accurate information, but it also shows empathy and provides emotional wellbeing support.</p>

										    <h2>Definition of Virtual Assistant</h2>
										</header>
										<p class="content">According to Wikipedia, an intelligent virtual assistant (IVA) or intelligent personal assistant (IPA) is a software agent that can perform tasks or services for an individual based on commands or questions. Some virtual assistants are able to interpret human speech and respond via synthesized voices. Users can ask their assistants questions, control home automation devices and media playback via voice, and manage other basic tasks such as email, to-do lists, and calendars with verbal commands. The assistant uses voice queries and a natural-language user interface to answer questions, make recommendations, and perform actions by delegating requests to a set of Internet services.</p>
